Fear of failure is a common obstacle to setting intentions. We may doubt our ability to achieve our goals, or fear the consequences of not succeeding. To overcome this obstacle, focus on the potential rewards of achieving your goals and the growth opportunities along the way.

External expectations, such as societal pressures or the expectations of others, can also be a barrier to setting intentions. To overcome this obstacle, align your intentions with your personal values and passions, and set boundaries with external expectations.

To overcome this obstacle, break goals into smaller steps, create an action plan, and stay accountable with deadlines and support from others.
